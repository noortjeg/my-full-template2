# My Whiskey Drop Walkalong Project

The Whiskey Drop page is a walkalong project for Code Institute's course on front-end development.

Bootstrap was used for the general formatting and then further css was added to customise the page. The code belongs to Code Institute and I coded along with the instructional videos.
